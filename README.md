# Portfolio-Project-1
This folder contains the SQL queries for analysing the data for COVID-19 infection rate throughout the different regions of the world and a focus on SEA region as well, till the end of July 2021. This project will go through simple and intermediate functions of SQL such as rank over() and using a common table expression (CTE).  
The data are then further visualised using Tableau and can be found on my public tableau folder at https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/kelvin.tan.wei.ming/viz/ProjectPortfolio-CovidAnalysis/Dashboard1
